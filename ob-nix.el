;; Simple org-babel language support for nix expressions

;;; Requirements:

;; nix as well as nix-instantiate has to be installed and available

;;; Code:
(require 'ob)
(require 'ob-ref)
(require 'ob-comint)
(require 'ob-eval)
;; possibly require modes required for your language

(defcustom ob-nix-command "nix-instantiate"
  "Name of command to use for executing nix code."
  :group 'org-babel
  :type 'string)

(defun org-babel-execute:nix (body params)
  "Evaluate nix code with org-babel.
Argument BODY takes a source blocks body.
Argument PARAMS takes a source block paramters."

	 (json (cdr (assoc :json params)))
	 (xml (cdr (assoc :xml params)))
